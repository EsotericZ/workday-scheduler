Homework Week 05

# Description
Take a simple calender application that saves events for each hour of the work day and modify it to update dynamically. The calendar will display the current day, show all timeblocks on the day, the timeblocks are color coded based on the time of day and events are able to be saved on each hour of the day.

# Changes Made To File
Created js file to change colors on times of day (past/present/future) - Also added functionality to save anything put into the calendar to local storage and set to fill back in upon reload. Used moment.js to show current day and track current time of day. Used existing css to make the page aesthetically pleasing.
